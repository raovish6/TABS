TABS: Transformer-based Automated Brain Segmentation

This repository contains the code for TABS, a CNN-Transformer hybrid automated brain tissue segmentation algorithm. We built our code off of the framework from Wang et al. (https://github.com/Wenxuan-1119/TransBTS) and also used some of their Transformer components.
